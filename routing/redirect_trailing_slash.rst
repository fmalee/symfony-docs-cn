    single: Routing; Redirect URLs with a trailing slash

使用尾随斜杠重定向网址
===================================

.. caution::

    In Symfony 4.1 the automatic URL redirection was improved as explained in
    :ref:`routing-trailing-slash-redirection`. That's why you no longer need to
    do that redirection yourself and this article has been removed because it's
    no longer needed.
